<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The passion for two-wheelers started when I first grabbed the keys to my father’s yellow Bajaj Priya scooter and rode it around my society. The thrill of freedom, even within those small lanes, sparked something in me. Soon after, my father bought a Bajaj Caliber, and that’s when I learned to ride a bike. As a teenager, I began venturing outside the society, carefully avoiding routes where cops patrolled, making sure my early adventures remained uninterrupted.</p>

<p>When I went to college, my elder brother bought a second-hand black Hero Honda CBZ—to this day, the most wonderful bike I have ever ridden. That machine had a soul, and every ride felt special. But after an unfortunate accident, we had to sell it. That loss didn’t keep me off the road for long; soon, I got myself a Yamaha FZ-S, while my brother went for a Yamaha Fazer. These bikes became our lifeline, carrying us across Delhi NCR and my college routes, turning everyday commutes into little adventures.</p>

<p>Over time, my FZ-S clocked over 1 lakh kilometers on the odometer. But as work pressure increased and life threw challenges my way, I found myself lost in a cycle of stress and self-doubt. It was during this phase that I stumbled upon a song—"Khudi" by The Local Train. Something about its lyrics struck a chord in me, reigniting the fire I had momentarily lost. I needed to escape, to rediscover myself on the road.</p>

<p>I started planning a solo trip on my old but reliable FZ-S. While researching Royal Enfield rides, I came across a biking group that was riding from Delhi to Leh-Ladakh. I reached out to a guy named Addy, who was initially welcoming, but the moment he heard I’d be riding an FZ-S, he straight-up said NO. Disappointed but undeterred, I moved on. But 15 minutes later, Addy called me back and said, “You can join.” That was it—the moment that changed everything.</p>

<p>Those 10 days in Ladakh were some of the best days of my life. It wasn’t just a trip; it was the start of something bigger. I went on to do a solo ride to Dehradun, followed by a 30-day solo trip across Madhya Pradesh on a friend’s Royal Enfield Classic 350. Eventually, I rode a Himalayan back to Leh-Ladakh, reliving that adventure in a new way.</p>

<p>Every ride since then has been a chapter in my story, each mile adding a new perspective to life. But this is just the beginning—because picture abhi baaki hai, mere dost.</p>
